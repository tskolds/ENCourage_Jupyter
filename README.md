# ENCourage_Jupyter
This is a short tutorial I made for students of ENCourage Engineering Math, a one-week program for incoming first-year engineering students to improve their math skills so they are ready to take calculus in their first year.  

The tutorial was a supplement to our graduate assistant's Python lesson during the program. Students had trouble downloading Jupyter Lab on Mac computers because Macs do not come with the pip package manager by default when Python is installed.  

My hope is that these students can play around with Python to get some coding experience before beginning their degree. In my first year of my engineering degree, I learned that programming is an incredibly valuable skill for engineering. I enjoyed working with the students and hope this helps them in their engineering journey.
